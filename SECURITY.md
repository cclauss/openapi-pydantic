# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As we're a small project and have limited maintainer capacity, only the latest major version of OpenAPI Pydantic is actively maintained. Whilst
we are pre-v1, this extends to the latest minor version - so only the latest 0.x version is actively maintained. Please update to the latest available
version before reporting bugs or security vulnerabilities.
